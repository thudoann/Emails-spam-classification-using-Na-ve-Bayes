# Emails-spam-classification-using-Na-ve-Bayes

This project is a part of the course Introduction to Data Science and AI given at Chalmers University of Technology in April 2022.

Grade 9/10.

In this assignment we worked with the dataset at https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/ which included three types of files in this locations: 

• easy-ham: non-spam messages typically quite easy to differentiate from spam messages.

• hard-ham: non-spam messages more difficult to differentiate

• spam: spam messages

The main purpose of this project is to implement a Na ̈ıve Bayes classifier that will classify emails into spam and non-spam (“ham”) classes. Na ̈ıve Bayes Classifier is one of the simplest and most efficient classification algorithms that helps to build fast predictive speed machine learning models. It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
